# Structure

- The Fourth Branch shall establish a central corporation known as The National
  Corporation of the United States of America.
- The National Corporation shall operate like a corporation in all respects
  except it shall be exempt from taxation.
- The Board of Directors functions similarly to a corporate board of directors
  but within the government.
- The board is accountable to the American people through a democratic process.

## Federally Elected Officials

- Seats are filled with federally elected officials to ensure democratic
  representation.
- All members of the Fourth Branch would be elected at the federal level.
- These elections could occur in a manner similar to Congressional elections but
  would be specific to this branch.

## Board Size and Composition

- To effectively carry out its duties, the Fourth Branch would have 21 board
  members.
- This size provides balance between broad representation and efficient
  governance.
- It enables adequate representation for a range of political parties,
  reflecting a multi-party electoral system.
- The odd number of board members helps to prevent voting deadlocks, ensuring
  that decision-making processes are not stymied.
