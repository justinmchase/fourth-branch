# Congressional Oversight

A dedicated committee within Congress would be responsible for overseeing The
Board's actions. This committee could hold hearings, request documents, and
summon board members for questioning regarding their decisions and market
activities as part of regular oversight processes or special inquiries.

## Transparency and Reporting Requirement

- The Board would be required to submit comprehensive reports to Congress on a
  regular basis detailing its activities, financial performance, decisions made,
  and the rationale behind them.
- Full financial disclosures by board members would be a part of these reports
  to maintain a high level of transparency.

## Investigative Powers

- Congress would have the authority to investigate potential misconduct, ethical
  breaches, or abuses of power by members of The Board. If warranted, these
  investigations could lead to formal recommendations for disciplinary actions
  or impeachment.

## Impeachment Procedures

- Specific procedures would be established for how Congress can impeach members
  of The Board. This would involve defining grounds for impeachment, such as
  malfeasance, nonfeasance, corruption, conflict of interest, or violation of
  established rules of The Board.
- A clear process for initiating impeachment proceedings, including but not
  limited to a majority vote in the committee of jurisdiction, followed by a
  full vote in the House of Representatives, should be outlined.

## Recommendation Process

- The procedural framework would also define how Congress can make
  recommendations to The Board. Such recommendations could pertain to policy,
  strategic direction, or reforms needed to enhance efficiency and integrity.
- While The Board is not obligated to act on these recommendations, ignoring
  them could lead to increased Congressional scrutiny or legislative actions.

## Confirmation of Appointments

- For appointed positions within The Board, Congress, specifically the Senate,
  would retain the power to confirm or deny these appointments, ensuring an
  additional layer of accountability.

## Legislative Checks

- Should Congressional investigations reveal systemic issues within The Board,
  Congress would have the power to propose and enact legislation to address
  these issues, adjust The Board's mandate, or reform procedural practices.

## Annual Reviews

- The Board would be subject to an annual review by Congress, during which its
  overall performance, impact on national economic policy, and individual member
  conduct are evaluated against established benchmarks.

## Public Access to Information

- Congress would ensure that The Board's records and actions are accessible to
  the public, except in cases where confidentiality is essential for security or
  sensitive negotiations.

By establishing these oversight mechanisms, Congress will have the means to hold
The Board and its members accountable for their actions while respecting the
independence that allows The Board to operate effectively within its mandate.
