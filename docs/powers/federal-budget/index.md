# Federal Budget

While The Board would not control the national budget directly, it can still
play a significant role in influencing fiscal policy and increasing the budget's
effectiveness. Here are some powers that could align with The Board's proposed
functions and objectives with respect to the national budget:

## Budgetary Recommendations

The Board could have the authority to analyze the budget and make non-binding
recommendations to Congress on fiscal policy adjustments to promote economic
stability, growth, and efficiency.

## Economic Forecasting and Analysis

With access to extensive data and economic insights, The Board could provide
advanced forecasting and analysis to help guide budgetary decisions made by
Congress and the Executive branch.

## Fiscal Impact Assessment

Before implementing major fiscal changes or new policies, Congress could require
The Board to conduct impact assessments that estimate the effects on
competition, market health, and long-term economic growth.

## Monitoring and Reporting

- The Board might be tasked with monitoring fiscal outcomes of budgetary
  allocations and reporting on whether they align with national economic
  objectives and legislative intent.
- Regular fiscal reports from The Board could inform lawmakers about the
  real-time impact of budgetary decisions and necessitate adjustments in future
  budgets.

## National Dividend Oversight

As the administrator of the National Dividend program, The Board could have the
power to determine when and how budget surpluses are returned to citizens as
dividends while ensuring the fiscal accountability of such distributions.

## Transparency and Public Engagement

The Board could have a role in enhancing the transparency of the budgetary
process, including fostering public understanding and discussion about fiscal
policies and their implications.

These powers would allow The Board to provide informed oversight and contribute
to fiscal decision-making without encroaching on the existing budgetary
responsibilities of Congress and the Executive branch. This would uphold the
principle of checks and balances and respect for the separation of powers in the
U.S. governmental system.
