# Federal Reserve

## Appointment Powers

- The Board shall participate in the nomination process by suggesting candidates
  for consideration to the President, who has the constitutional authority to
  make appointments subject to Senate confirmation.
- The Board shall also be given a formal advisory role when the President is
  selecting nominees for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, which would
  involve assessing candidates' qualifications based on their expertise in
  economics and finance.

## Removal Powers

- The Board shall be granted the authority to initiate a review or investigation
  if there are clear concerns about a member's performance or ethics. The
  findings could then be presented to the President or Congress, who would make
  the final decision on whether to take action.

## Confirmation Process Involvement

- The Board might play a role in the Congressional confirmation process by
  providing an assessment of the qualifications of Federal Reserve nominees.
  This role could involve testifying before the relevant Senate committee or
  providing detailed reports on the nominees' suitability.
- If given a more formal place in the confirmation process, The Board could be
  empowered to vote on an advisory basis, giving Senators additional expert
  insight into the nominees' capabilities and alignment with national economic
  goals without holding veto power.

## Periodic Performance Reviews

- The Board could be tasked with conducting periodic performance reviews of
  Federal Reserve officials. While these reviews wouldn't have the power to
  directly remove members, they could inform the reappointment process and offer
  transparency into membersâ€™ effectiveness and accountability.
- Negative findings in performance reviews could trigger a more in-depth
  investigation, potentially leading to recommendations for dismissal.

By incorporating The Board into the appointment and oversight processes in these
ways, we preserve the critical independence of the Federal Reserve while
leveraging The Board's expertise to enhance the quality and accountability of
the Fed's leadership. These measures could serve as a check on the Federal
Reserve without compromising its ability to set monetary policy free from
immediate political pressures.
