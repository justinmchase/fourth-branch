# Acquisition of Monopolistic Companies

The Board shall have the power to purchase companies that are identified as
monopolistic through anti-trust investigations. Rather than mandating the
breakup of these companies, The Board is empowered to offer a comprehensive
buyout at fair market value. This acquisition process would be conducted in a
manner akin to a corporate takeover, whereby The Board negotiates and pays a
price that reflects the true economic worth of the company in question.

This power ensures that monopolistic firms can be addressed effectively,
converting them from potential sources of market inefficiency into assets that
can contribute to the public good. Post-acquisition, these companies would be
managed by The Board with the dual aim of promoting healthy competition in the
market and generating revenue that can be utilized as part of the National
Dividend program or reinvested as needed.

The Board's acquisition power is designed to serve as a direct intervention
mechanism to maintain fairness and dynamism in the marketplace, while also
providing a potential financial boon to the economy and its citizens through
strategic management and eventual profit-sharing.
