## National Dividend Administration

The Board shall possess the exclusive power to administer the National Dividend,
a program designed to distribute a share of the nation’s wealth to every U.S.
citizen in the form of a non-transferable Share. This initiative reflects the
conviction that all citizens should benefit from the collective economic success
and productivity of the nation. The guidelines for the National Dividend are as
follows:

## Issuance of Shares

- A single, non-transferable Share is granted to each citizen at birth or upon
  the attainment of citizenship, representing a stake in the economic prosperity
  of the country.

## Dividend Distribution

- The Board calculates dividends based on a predetermined formula reflecting the
  profits and surplus generated by its activities and the overall economic
  performance of the nation.
- These dividends are distributed regularly, for instance, annually or
  semi-annually, to all Shareholders in an equal manner.

## Tax Free

Proceeds from the National Dividend shall be considered tax-free and no tax or
duty or garnishing shall every be applied to the dividends of the people.

## Registration of Citizens

- The Board maintains a comprehensive and secure registry of all individuals who
  hold Shares to ensure accurate and efficient distribution of dividends.

## Funding Source

- The sources for the National Dividend can include profits from The Board’s
  acquisitions and operations, surplus federal revenues, and potentially other
  innovative streams of income designed to benefit the public welfare.

## Economic Stabilization Mechanism

- The National Dividend may also serve as a tool for macroeconomic
  stabilization, injecting purchasing power into the economy during downturns or
  retracting it in times of inflationary pressure, as directed by prudent
  economic policies.

## Transparent Accounting

- The Board provides clear and transparent accounting for how National Dividend
  amounts are calculated and the source of the funds distributed, reinforcing
  public trust and promoting fiscal responsibility.

## Adjustment of Dividend

- The Board is authorized to adjust the size of the dividend based on economic
  conditions, financial performance of its acquisitions, and other relevant
  fiscal factors, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the National Dividend
  program.

## Legislative Framework

- The creation and continuous management of the National Dividend are anchored
  in legislation that outlines the procedures, rules, and protections governing
  the program to guard against undue political influence and ensure that it
  focuses on providing equal benefits for all citizens.

The National Dividend serves as a tangible embodiment of The Board's commitment
to economic inclusivity and shared prosperity, thereby empowering every citizen
as a stakeholder in the nation’s future.
