# The Fourth Branch

This site describes a hypothetical proposal to create a fourth branch of federal
government known as The Board of Directors and the establishment of a National
Corporation of The United States of America.

The Board of Directors would serve a vital role in promoting competitive market
practices and intervening in monopolistic dynamics within the economy. As the
board of directors for The National Corporation, its members oversee this
central entity tasked with the strategic stewardship of acquired companies. The
National Corporation embodies the operational arm of The Board.

An integral part of The Board’s responsibilities also involves administering the
National Dividend, distributing a share of the nation's economic achievements to
citizens and reinforcing the collective ownership of the nation’s economic
success. The establishment of The National Corporation ensures a concrete and
efficient execution of The Board's mandate, with a focus on transparency,
accountability, and a commitment to enhancing the general economic welfare while
delivering equal benefits to every U.S. citizen.
