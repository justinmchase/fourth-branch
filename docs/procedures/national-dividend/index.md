# National Dividend

The procedure for the National Dividend includes the initial issuance of a Share
upon citizenshipâ€”whether by birth or naturalization. A system would be
established to accurately track every citizen's entitlements and the
disbursement of dividends. Profits generated from various government activities,
including revenues from government-run enterprises or surplus funds, would be
calculated, and a proportion of this would be paid out as a dividend to Share
holders of the United States.
