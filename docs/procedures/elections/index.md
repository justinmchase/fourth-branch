# Election Process

To enrich democratic representation beyond the existing two-party system, the
Fourth Branch's election process would be structured around political party
votes rather than individual candidates.

Every 2 years during the standard federal election period approximately half of
the seats should be up for re-election.

## Party-Centric Elections

- Citizens would cast their votes for political parties instead of individual
  candidates during the election of the Fourth Branch's board of directors.
- Citizens cast direct votes for their preferred party which is counted across
  all states without electors or gerrymandering.

## Proportional Representation

- Once the election has concluded each participating political party would
  nominate representatives to fill the board's seats in proportion to the
  percentage of the vote that the party received.

## Nomination Process

- Parties are free to develop their own internal processes for nominating
  representatives to the board.
- These processes could include primary elections, selection committees, or any
  method that aligns with the partyâ€™s principles and structures.

## Finality of Nomination

- Once a party nominates its representatives, these individuals would serve for
  the full term of the office, regardless of their continued standing with the
  party that nominated them over that term.
