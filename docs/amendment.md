# Constituional Amendment

Below is a hypothetical proposed Constitutional Amendment to establish a Fourth
Branch of the federal government.

## Amendment XXVIII

### Section 1. Establishment of the Fourth Branch

The Board of Directors of the National Corporation of the United States of
America is hereby established as the Fourth Branch of the Federal Government,
with the responsibility of promoting competitive market practices, managing
acquisitions of monopolistic companies, administering the National Dividend, and
ensuring the economic welfare of the nation.

### Section 2. Board of Directors

The Fourth Branch shall consist of a Board of Directors that oversees The
National Corporation, which serves as the operational arm with the authority to
acquire monopolistic companies, promote fair competition, and implement the
National Dividend program.

The election of the Board of Directors shall embody democratic representation
and allow for proportional representation of political parties, ensuring broad
participation in the governance of the Fourth Branch.

### Section 3. National Dividend and Share Entitlement

The Board shall be charged with the administration of the National Dividend,
which distributes a single non-transferable Share of the National Corporation to
every U.S. citizen, by birth or naturalization, empowering them as stakeholders
in the nation’s economic success.

The National Dividend shall be maintained through profits garnered from various
activities and acquisitions of the National Corporation. Annually, or at such
other regular intervals as deemed appropriate by The Board, dividends shall be
calculated relative to these profits or surplus funds and distributed equally
amongst all Shareholders.

### Section 4. Operation and Powers of The Board

In preserving the public trust and averting economic stagnation wrought by
monopolistic entities, The Board shall possess the power to acquire companies
identified through antitrust inquiries. Such acquisitions shall be executed at
fair market values and managed by The Board to encourage competitive markets and
stimulate economic success to be shared with all Shareholders.

The Board's budget shall be specifically allocated to empower it to purchase
aforementioned companies and to implement and maintain the National Dividend
program. The sources for the National Dividend can include profits from The
Board’s acquisitions and operations, and potentially other innovative revenue
streams designed to benefit public welfare.

### Section 5. Oversight and Accountability

The Board shall operate under a system of checks and balances, including term
limits for board members, financial auditing procedures, conflict of interest
policies, transparency requirements, and mechanisms for recourse or removal of
board members if necessary.

Congress shall establish a dedicated committee responsible for the oversight of
The Board's actions, including powers of investigation, transparency, and
reporting requirements, to maintain accountability and align the Fourth Branch
with the public interest.

### Section 6. The Federal Reserve

The Board shall have an advisory voice in the nomination and confirmation
process of Federal Reserve governors and the Chair and shall possess the power
to initiate reviews or investigations regarding any concerns about Federal
Reserve members' performance or ethics.

### Section 7. The Federal Budget

The Board shall contribute to the federal budget process by providing economic
forecasting and analysis, non-binding budgetary recommendations to Congress, and
enhancing transparency in the fiscal decision-making process, while respecting
existing Congressional and Executive branch responsibilities.

### Section 8. Enactment and Implementation

The provisions laid out in this Amendment shall be enacted pursuant to
regulations and procedures established by Congress, which shall also have the
authority to yield legislation for the further refinement and adjustment of The
Board's practices. This encompasses stipulations for the appointment, tenure,
and conduct of its members so as to fortify the institutional integrity and to
foster unwavering dedication to the betterment of the American polity.

Thus should our Republic grow in stature, bettering the condition of each
inhabitant, and spreading the light of liberty to every corner of American
society.
