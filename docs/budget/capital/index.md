# Captial

The Board's budget, distinct from the general federal budget, will be
specifically allocated to empower it to purchase companies demonstrating
monopolistic tendencies, as determined by antitrust investigations. Here's how
The Board's funding strategy might be structured:

## Initial Capitalization

A foundational capital injection provided by Congress through special
legislation to kickstart The Board’s operations.

## Ongoing Capitalization

Yearly capital appropriations decided by Congress, based on The Board's
performance, potential acquisition targets, and overall strategy alignment with
national economic interests.

## Self-Generated Revenue

Profits from the operation and management of acquired companies are reinvested
into The Board’s capital pool, fostering financial independence and growth over
time.

## Issuance of Bonds

Authority to issue bonds to investors, leveraging future earnings from National
Dividend distributions or profits of managed companies, thereby diversifying
funding sources.

## Profit Reinvestment

- A feedback mechanism where a designated portion of revenue generated through
  The Board's activities is rolled back into acquisitions and operations.
- Structured reinvestment policies will ensure that capital remains available
  for future strategic maneuvers and dividends are sustained.

## Service Fees

The Board could also collect fees for regulatory services it provides, which in
turn would contribute to its operating budget.

## Public-Private Partnerships

Leveraging relationships with the private sector through partnerships for
co-investing in the acquisition of monopolistic companies, reducing the capital
burden solely placed on public funds.

Each element of this funding framework is designed with checks and balances in
mind to ensure that The Board operates with financial integrity and regards for
the public interest while retaining the agility needed to respond to
monopolistic behavior in the marketplace effectively.
