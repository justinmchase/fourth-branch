# Operating Expenses

Beyond capital for acquisitions, The Board's budget should account for all the
operational expenses associated with running an organization of its scope and
responsibility. These costs should be transparent and justifiable to maintain
public trust. Here are some categories of operating costs to consider:

## Board Member Salaries

- As full-time positions, board members should receive salaries commensurate
  with their responsibilities and in line with public service executive
  compensation to attract qualified professionals.
- Compensation should be determined by legislation or a designated independent
  commission to prevent conflicts of interest.

## Administrative Staff

- Salaries and benefits for a support staff, including legal experts,
  economists, policy analysts, and administrative personnel.
- These would be critical for executing The Board’s mandate efficiently.

## Operating Expenses

- Office rent, utilities, and the purchase of necessary equipment and supplies.
- Costs associated with maintaining a headquarters and any regional offices as
  necessary for nationwide operations.

## Technology and Infrastructure

- Investments in secure, state-of-the-art technology systems for operations,
  data analysis, and protection against cyber threats.
- Infrastructure costs also include the development and maintenance of systems
  needed to implement and manage the National Dividend program.

## Legal and Compliance

- Funds for legal consultations, compliance with regulations, and potential
  litigation costs.
- Since The Board will be engaged in complex legal processes such as antitrust
  investigations and company acquisitions, robust legal support is essential.

## Audit and Accountability

- Budget for internal audits and third-party reviews to ensure operations adhere
  to stringent standards of accountability and financial probity.

## Research and Development

- Allocation for research activities and policy development which are key to The
  Board’s mandate for maintaining a dynamic and competitive market landscape.

## Training and Professional Development

- Funding for continual training and development for The Board’s staff to stay
  updated with changes in economic theory, market conditions, and regulatory
  best practices.

## Public Outreach and Education

- Activities to engage and inform the public regarding The Board's operations,
  fiscal policy, and economic health of the country, furthering transparency and
  fostering an informed citizenry.

The Board’s operating budget should be reflective of the necessary costs to
fulfill its responsibilities both effectively and transparently, maintaining the
highest standards of public sector accountability and efficiency.
