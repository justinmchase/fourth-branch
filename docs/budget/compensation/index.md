# Compensation

To avoid conflicts of interest and ensure the highest ethical standards, it
would be necessary and prudent to explicitly state that The Board should be
compensated solely through a fixed salary. By doing so, it emphasizes that their
compensation is not influenced by the profitability or financial performance of
The Board's activities, which is crucial for maintaining public trust and
ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of the nation's economic health
rather than personal financial gain.

A clear compensation policy would need to be detailed in the legislation
creating The Board that outlines the following:

## Fixed Salary

Board members receive a set annual salary determined by appropriate public
service compensation standards, with no additional compensation tied to
performance metrics or financial results.

## Transparency

All compensation agreements are made publicly available to ensure transparency
and accountability to the citizens they serve.

## Prohibitions on Bonuses

An explicit prohibition on bonuses, stock options, or other forms of
incentive-based compensation typically associated with the private sector.

## No Outside Income

Restrict or prohibit board members from receiving any form of outside income
derived from industries they regulate or having financial stakes in businesses
that could present a conflict of interest.
