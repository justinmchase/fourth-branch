This is a combination of ideas I stole from various sources over time. One
notable source is Robert H. Heinlein is his book "For Us, The Living" where he
describes a national dividend and a hypothetical utopian society. This proposal
is dedicated to him and his immense modern contribution to civics and Science
Fiction.

I also owe a lot of thanks to Chat GPT which helped me organize and summarize
these ideas as well as expound upon them. Additionally the conversations of a
few cynics and critics along the way have helped address some edge cases and bad
directions.
