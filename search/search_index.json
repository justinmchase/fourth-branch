Amendment XX Section 1. The Board of Directors of the National Corporation of the United States of America is hereby established as the Fourth Branch of the Federal Government, with the responsibility of promoting competitive market practices, managing acquisitions of monopolistic companies, administering the National Dividend, and ensuring the economic welfare of the nation. Section 2. The Fourth Branch shall consist of a Board of Directors that oversees The National Corporation, which serves as the operational arm with the authority to acquire monopolistic companies, promote fair competition, and implement the National Dividend program. Section 3. The Board shall have the power to purchase companies identified as monopolistic through anti-trust investigations and manage them to promote healthy competition in the market and generate revenue for the National Dividend program. Section 4. The Board shall be charged with the administration of the National Dividend, which distributes a non-transferable Share of the nation's wealth to every U.S. citizen, empowering them as stakeholders in the nation\u2019s economic success. Section 5. The election of the Board of Directors shall embody democratic representation and allow for proportional representation of political parties, ensuring equitable participation in the governance of the Fourth Branch. Section 6. The Board shall operate under a system of checks and balances, including term limits for board members, financial auditing procedures, conflict of interest policies, transparency requirements, and mechanisms for recourse or removal of board members if necessary. Section 7. Congress shall establish a dedicated committee responsible for the oversight of The Board's actions, including powers of investigation, transparency, and reporting requirements, to maintain accountability and align the Fourth Branch with the public interest. Section 8. The Board's budget shall be specifically allocated to empower it to purchase aforementioned companies and to implement and maintain the National Dividend program. The sources for the National Dividend can include profits from The Board\u2019s acquisitions and operations, and potentially other innovative revenue streams designed to benefit public welfare. Section 9. The Board shall have an advisory voice in the nomination and confirmation process of Federal Reserve governors and the Chair and shall possess the power to initiate reviews or investigations regarding any concerns about Federal Reserve members' performance or ethics. Section 10. The Board shall contribute to the federal budget process by providing economic forecasting and analysis, non-binding budgetary recommendations to Congress, and enhancing transparency in the fiscal decision-making process, while respecting existing Congressional and Executive branch responsibilities. Section 11. This amendment shall go into effect one year from the date of ratification, providing ample time for the establishment of the necessary structures and processes within the Fourth Branch.","title":"Amendment"},{"location":"budget/capital/","text":"Captial The Board's budget, distinct from the general federal budget, will be specifically allocated to empower it to purchase companies demonstrating monopolistic tendencies, as determined by antitrust investigations.

Ongoing Capitalization Yearly capital appropriations decided by Congress, based on The Board's performance, potential acquisition targets, and overall strategy alignment with national economic interests.

Here are suggested guidelines for recusal: Mandatory Recusal If a board member has any level of ownership or financial interest in a company up for acquisition by The Board, they should be required to recuse themselves from any discussions, deliberations, or votes related to that particular acquisition. Ownership Threshold for Recusal Establishing a clear threshold for recusal can be challenging as even a small stake in a company could influence a board member's judgment. However, a common standard is to set a specific percentage of ownership (for instance, 1% or 5%) or any interest that affords substantive influence or control over the company as the threshold triggering recusal. Disclosure Requirements Board members should disclose all financial interests in companies within The Board's purview at the time of their election or appointment and update this information regularly. Transparency is paramount to address any potential conflicts proactively. Independent Verification An independent ethics committee or compliance officer should periodically verify disclosures and identify conflicts, triggering recusal as necessary. Non-Voting Participation In some instances, a board member with industry expertise may still provide valuable, non-biased insights into an acquisition without participating in the voting process. Clear guidelines should determine when non-voting participation is permissible and must be stringently monitored. Substitute Decision-makers In cases where a member's recusal could impact the board's ability to make an informed decision, processes should be in place to allow for alternate expertise or temporary non-voting advisors to provide necessary information without having a stake in the outcome. Legal Consequences There should be clear legal consequences for failing to recuse oneself when there's a direct financial interest, ranging from censure to removal from The Board and potential legal prosecution.

The guidelines for the National Dividend are as follows: Issuance of Shares A single, non-transferable Share is granted to each citizen at birth or upon the attainment of citizenship, representing a stake in the economic prosperity of the country. Dividend Distribution The Board calculates dividends based on a predetermined formula reflecting the profits and surplus generated by its activities and the overall economic performance of the nation. These dividends are distributed regularly, for instance, annually or semi-annually, to all Shareholders in an equal manner. Registration of Citizens The Board maintains a comprehensive and secure registry of all individuals who hold Shares to ensure accurate and efficient distribution of dividends. Funding Source The sources for the National Dividend can include profits from The Board\u2019s acquisitions and operations, surplus federal revenues, and potentially other innovative streams of income designed to benefit the public welfare. Economic Stabilization Mechanism The National Dividend may also serve as a tool for macroeconomic stabilization, injecting purchasing power into the economy during downturns or retracting it in times of inflationary pressure, as directed by prudent economic policies. Transparent Accounting The Board provides clear and transparent accounting for how National Dividend amounts are calculated and the source of the funds distributed, reinforcing public trust and promoting fiscal responsibility. Adjustment of Dividend The Board is authorized to adjust the size of the dividend based on economic conditions, financial performance of its acquisitions, and other relevant fiscal factors, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the National Dividend program.
